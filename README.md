The purpose of this git repository is to store all my homework files. These
files will be stored in separate directories within the repository 
corresponding to the homework number. 

For example, homework 01 will have its own separate directory that will
contain the solution to question 1, 2, and 3. I will continue to do the same
format for homework 02 and so on.
