# Homework 02 -- No One JSON

*The purpose of this homework assignment is to familiarize ourselves with JSON files.* 

Part 1 makes us insert randomized data into a new JSON file. The new JSON file has the site identification number, the latitude and 
longitude at which the meteorite is located, and it's composition. Using the 'cat meteorite_site.json' command, we can see the 
data displayed in dictionary format. 

Part 2 has us call down a function and use the data to calculate time and distance. The robot will go from Mars to Meteorite 1, then
from Meteorite 1 to Meteorite 2, and so on until we get to Meteorite 5. Then, we will use the distance from the first location to the
second to calculate the distance and therefore time traveled. Depending on the composition of the meteorite, we can also calculate how
long it took for the robot to sample it. All of this is listed out when using the 'python3 calculate_trip.py' command.
